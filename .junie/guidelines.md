# Technical Guidelines for Task List Management

## Working with docs/tasks.md

### Task Completion Tracking

**Marking Tasks as Complete:**
- Change `[ ]` to `[x]` when a task is fully completed
- Only mark tasks as complete when all acceptance criteria are met
- Update the progress tracking section at the bottom of the file when marking tasks complete

**Example:**
```markdown
- [x] 1. Configure Spring Boot project with Kotlin support [P0] [R12, R13]
- [ ] 2. Add core dependencies (Spring Web, JPA, Security, Mail, Thymeleaf) [P0] [R12, R13]
```

### Task Organization System

**Priority Levels:**
- **P0 (Critical):** Must-have for prototype readiness - these tasks are essential for the minimum viable product
- **P1 (Important):** Important features that should be implemented in the near term
- **P2 (Nice-to-have):** Stretch goals and enhancements that can be deferred

**Requirement Mappings:**
- Each task includes `[R#]` references linking to specific requirements in docs/requirements.md
- Use these mappings to ensure all requirements are covered
- Cross-reference with docs/plan.md for additional context

**Phase Organization:**
- Tasks are grouped into 11 development phases (Phase 0-11)
- Follow phases sequentially for optimal dependency management
- Some tasks within phases can be parallelized, but maintain phase order

### Progress Tracking Guidelines

**Updating Progress Statistics:**
When tasks are completed, update the progress tracking section at the bottom of docs/tasks.md:

```markdown
**Progress Tracking:**
- Completed: X/143 (Y%)
- In Progress: X/143 (Y%)
- Not Started: X/143 (Y%)
```

**Phase-Level Tracking:**
- Track completion by priority level (P0, P1, P2)
- Monitor critical path items (P0 tasks) closely
- Ensure P0 tasks are completed before moving to P1/P2 tasks

### Task Update Procedures

**Adding New Tasks:**
- Insert new tasks in the appropriate phase section
- Assign sequential numbers within the phase
- Include priority level and requirement mappings
- Update total task count at the bottom

**Modifying Existing Tasks:**
- Update task descriptions as requirements evolve
- Maintain requirement mappings accuracy
- Preserve task numbering for consistency
- Document significant changes in commit messages

**Task Dependencies:**
- Some tasks have implicit dependencies (e.g., entities before repositories)
- Review phase descriptions in docs/plan.md for dependency guidance
- Consider blocking relationships when planning work

### Quality Assurance

**Before Marking Tasks Complete:**
- Verify all acceptance criteria are met
- Ensure unit tests are written and passing (where applicable)
- Confirm integration with existing components
- Update documentation if the task affects APIs or user interfaces

**Milestone Validation:**
- At the end of each phase, review all completed tasks
- Validate that phase objectives are met
- Test integration points between phases
- Update docs/plan.md if significant deviations occur
