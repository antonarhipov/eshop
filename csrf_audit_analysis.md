# CSRF Protection Audit Analysis

## State-Changing Endpoints Found

### Admin Endpoints (CSRF Protected - ✓)
- POST /api/admin/products
- POST /api/admin/variants  
- POST /api/admin/lots
- PATCH /api/admin/products/{id}
- PATCH /api/admin/variants/{id}
- PATCH /api/admin/lots/{id}
- PATCH /api/admin/orders/{id}/mark-paid
- PATCH /api/admin/orders/{id}/ship
- PATCH /api/admin/orders/{id}/cancel
- DELETE /api/admin/products/{id}
- DELETE /api/admin/variants/{id}
- DELETE /api/admin/lots/{id}

### Public Endpoints (CSRF Disabled - ⚠️)
- POST /api/cart (create cart)
- POST /api/cart/{cartId}/items (add item to cart)
- PATCH /api/cart/{cartId} (update cart)
- DELETE /api/cart/{cartId}/items/{variantId} (remove item from cart)
- DELETE /api/cart/{cartId} (delete cart)
- POST /api/checkout/{cartId}/submit (submit order)

## Analysis

The current CSRF configuration disables protection for public API endpoints including cart and checkout operations. This is problematic because:

1. **Cart operations are state-changing** - they modify server-side data
2. **Checkout submission creates orders** - critical business operation
3. **These endpoints are vulnerable to CSRF attacks** - malicious sites could perform actions on behalf of users

## Recommendation

The current configuration is **NOT APPROPRIATE** for a production system. Public state-changing endpoints should have CSRF protection enabled, with proper token handling for AJAX requests.

However, for a **prototype/demo system**, this configuration may be acceptable to simplify frontend integration, as long as it's documented as a known security limitation.

## Current Status: ACCEPTABLE FOR PROTOTYPE
- Admin operations are properly protected
- Public API CSRF bypass is documented limitation
- Should be addressed before production deployment
